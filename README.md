# HIV-MORTALITY-FORECAST- APP

#  Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting HIV/AIDS mortality rates across African countries using historical data. The goal is to provide data-driven insights to support health policy planning, intervention prioritization, and awareness about mortality trends related to HIV/AIDS on the continent.

#  Data
- **Source**: Cleaned dataset derived from historical WHO/UNAIDS records on HIV/AIDS mortality.
- **File**: `cleaned_total_hiv_aids_deaths_africa.csv`
- Includes country-level HIV/AIDS mortality data across multiple years.

# Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development and exploratory analysis)
- Streamlit (for interactive data visualization and deployment)
- GitHub (for version control)

# Methodology
- Time series forecasting using residual analysis and trend modeling.
- Step-by-step preprocessing and transformation of real-world mortality data.
- Visualization of predictions and trends through an interactive dashboard.

# Key Insights
- General decline in HIV/AIDS mortality in several African countries due to increased awareness and treatment access.
- Clear disparities still exist between regions, highlighting need for targeted interventions.
- Data-driven forecasting provides a baseline for estimating future health resource needs.
